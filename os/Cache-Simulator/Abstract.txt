Cache Simulator
This Cache Simulator is a Python project designed to simulate the behavior of a cache memory system in computer architecture. 
It provides a way to understand how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated in a cache, allowing users to experiment and analyze cache performance.

Features
The Cache Simulator includes the following features:

Cache Configuration: The simulator supports various cache configurations, including cache size, block size, associativity, and replacement policy. 
Users can customize these parameters to model different cache architectures.

Memory Access: The simulator allows users to perform memory read and write operations. It simulates the cache hierarchy by checking if data is present in the cache or
needs to be fetched from the main memory.

Cache Statistics: The simulator collects statistics on cache hits, misses, and overall cache performance. It provides insights into cache behavior and efficiency, 
helping users evaluate the effectiveness of different cache configurations and policies.

Visualization: The simulator offers graphical representation and visualization of cache contents and access patterns. Users can visualize cache blocks, 
memory addresses, and the flow of data within the cache.

To run the program:
Install python and then install tkinter module
Run cache2.py
