Abstract:

*The implemented student database system utilizes the B-tree data structure in C++ to efficiently store and manage student records. A B-tree is a self-balancing search
tree that maintains sorted data and provides efficient operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching. 

*The database system consists of a B-tree where each node represents a collection of student records. Each node has a defined minimum degree, determining the minimum 
number of keys it can hold, as well as child pointers to other nodes. The leaf nodes store the actual student records, while the non-leaf nodes serve as intermediate 
levels for faster searching.

*The system supports various operations, including adding a new student record, deleting a student record, and searching for student records based on specific criteria 
such as Roll number. The B-tree structure ensures that the operations have a time complexity of O(log n), making it efficient even for large-scale databases.

*The student database system provides a reliable and scalable solution for storing and managing student records. It is designed to handle a large number of records 
and supports efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. The B-tree data structure ensures that the system can maintain balanced performance even as the 
database grows in size.
