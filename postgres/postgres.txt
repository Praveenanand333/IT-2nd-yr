JOIN

1)cross join :
matches every row of the first table with every row of the second table
If the input tables have x and y columns, respectively, the resulting table will have x+y columns
ex:SELECT EMP_ID, NAME, DEPT FROM COMPANY CROSS JOIN DEPARTMENT;

2)Inner join:
A INNER JOIN creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables (table1 and table2) based upon the join-predicate(condition)
When the join-predicate is satisfied, column values for each matched pair of rows of table1 and table2 are combined into a result row.

3)left outer join:
first a innser joint is performed
Then, for each row in table T1 that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in table T2, a joined row is added with null values in columns of T2. 
Thus, the joined table always has at least one row for each row in T1.

6)natural join
 difference between INNER JOIN and NATURAL JOIN is the number of columns returned.
 it omits duplicate coulmns
